3.- At least define 3 rules on how the chatbot should react to different emotional states of the customer (e.g. if the customer is frustrated, do...; if the customer is enthusiastic, do...; if the customer is confused, do...).

4.- Bot that demonstrates the 3 previous steps.

5.- Build at least 4 test cases with human participants acting as customers. Small report with personality and emotions detected.

**Deliverables**:

- Project report (max 5 pages) explaining each step.
